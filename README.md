#  Key Insights
  - United States and Australia together contribute over 60% of the total country-wise sales.
  - North America leads in group-wise sales with 38.72%, followed by Pacific and Europe.
  - The Bikes category contributes a massive 96.46% of all category sales, indicating a very skewed product focus.
  - 2013 was the strongest year, accounting for 55.70% of yearly sales.
  - Sales peak around June and December, with December showing the highest monthly sales at ‚Çπ3.21M.
  - All top 5 products are from the Mountain-200 series, just with different sizes, suggesting high customer preference for this specific model.
  - A healthy profit margin of 30.65% with ‚Çπ29.36M in sales and 60.40K orders reflects strong operational performance.

#  Why This Project Stands Out 
  - Intuitive layout with KPIs at the top and detailed visuals below.
  - Interactive filters for metric, year, and category allow users to customize views instantly.
  - Covers Sales, Profit, Orders, and Production Cost‚Äîenabling multi-metric analysis from one dashboard.<br>
  - Offers insights at global, regional, product, and time-based levels.
  - Each chart supports a specific business question (e.g., Which country performs best?, Which year was most profitable?). 
  - Use of color-coded visuals and labels improves readability and comparison. 
  - Highlights both absolute values (e.g., ‚Çπ29.36M in sales) and relative performance (e.g., 96% bike sales).
  - Makes it easy for stakeholders to identify key drivers and laggards.<br/>
  - Combines various chart types: bar, pie, line, stacked bars. <br/>
  - Efficient use of parameter controls and dynamic metric switching enhances usability.

#  Project Highlights
- Users can switch between Sales, Profit, Orders, and Production Cost using radio buttons, making the dashboard flexible and multi-purpose.
- Total Sales: ‚Çπ29.36M
- Profit Margin: 30.65%
- Total Orders: 60.40K
- Country-wise and group-wise sales charts reveal top-performing regions (e.g., US and North America).
- Useful for regional strategy planning.
- Top 5 Products section shows bestsellers‚Äîmainly the Mountain-200 series.
- Category-wise breakdown shows heavy dependence on Bikes (96.46%).
- Monthly Sales line chart highlights peak months.
- Year-wise sales pie chart helps compare year-over-year performance, with 2013 being the strongest.
- Year and Category filters allow users to drill down into specific time frames or product lines for deeper analysis.
- Cohesive color scheme, use of brand logo, and organized layout make the dashboard professional and easy to navigate.

# Insights generated From Dashboard
1. Overdependence on Bikes Category (96.46%)
- <b>Insight:<b/> Heavy reliance on a single category is risky.
- <b>Action:<b/> Diversify product offerings by promoting underperforming categories (Accessories & Clothing) through bundling, discounts, or improved marketing strategies.

2. Product Focus: Mountain-200 Series Dominance
- <b>Insight:<b/> Top 5 products are all from the same product line.
- <b>Action:<b/> Analyze customer preferences in the Mountain-200 line and develop similar high-margin products or variants to capitalize on this trend.

3. Geographic Imbalance in Sales
- <b>Insight:<b/> US and Australia account for the majority of sales.
- <b>Action:<b/> Conduct targeted campaigns or partnerships in underperforming markets (e.g., Canada and France) to increase revenue and reduce reliance on a few countries.

4. Uneven Monthly Sales
- <b>Insight:<b/> Sales peak in June and December; other months underperform.
- <b>Action:<b/> Launch mid-year and off-season campaigns to balance monthly sales and maintain steady cash flow throughout the year.

5. High Sales But Potential Production Costs
- <b>Insight:<b/> High sales and orders don‚Äôt always equal high profit if production costs are not optimized.
- <b>Action:<b/> Use production cost data to analyze profit per product and eliminate or reprice low-margin products.

6. Expand High-Performing Product Lines
- <b>Insight:<b/> Mountain-200 models are preferred across sizes.
- <b>Action:<b/>  Introduce new models with upgraded features or accessories to increase Average Order Value (AOV).

7. Leverage High-Profit Regions for Premium Offerings
- <b>Insight:<b/> North America leads in revenue.
- <b>Action:<b/> Test high-margin, premium offerings or services (e.g., extended warranties, memberships) in top regions.

8. Yearly Sales Trends: Learn from 2013
- <b>Insight:<b/> 2013 delivered 55.70% of total sales.
- <b>Action:<b/> Analyze 2013's strategy (promotions, pricing, campaigns) and replicate what worked.

9. Refine Marketing Based on Seasonality
- <b>Insight:<b/> Strong end-of-year sales.
- <b>Action:<b/> Allocate marketing budget toward months with high conversion potential (especially Q4), while testing strategies in weaker months.

10. Customer Segmentation & Personalization
- <b>Insight:<b/> Top-selling product and region data imply strong customer segments.
- <b>Action:<b/> Use customer data to build targeted email and ad campaigns based on past purchase behavior and location.
